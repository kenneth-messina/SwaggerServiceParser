# JavaScript Service Generator

Run this script to automatically convert swagger's generated json into javascript services.

## API Service

The generated files assume there exists another service for encapsulating the actual http calls for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. Adjust the `appsettings.json` file to reflect the location for this file relative to the service files destination.

## Service Liss (appsettings.json)

Use `appsettings.json` to confirgure the ServiceList so that each entry contains the following:

- "swagger" : location of the json generated by swagger.
- "api-path": common relative path to append to api calls.
- "folder-path": destination for the service file to be placed. This may be absolute or relative.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "swagger": "http://officecomputer.local/my-api/swagger/v1/swagger.json",
    "api-path": "/api/gateway",
    "folder-path": "C:\\code\\app\\services\\"
  },
  {
    "swagger": "http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json",
    "api-path": "/api/accounts",
    "folder-path": "C:\\code\\app\\services\\"
  }
]
```
